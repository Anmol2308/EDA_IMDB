# IMDB Movies Dataset Analysis

### I did an exploratory data analysis on imdb movies dataset found on kaggle. I found the following results after cleaning and exploring the data:
### Which movie made the highest profit? Who were its producer and director and the actors in that film?
### The unique genres of movies in this dataset.
### Making a table of all the producers and directors of each movie. Finding the top 3 producers who have produced movies with the highest average RoI.
